# 📚 Buddies — Documentation Index

> **Living document.** Auto-updated as new docs are added throughout the project.

This is the master index of all project documentation. Three categories:

- **📘 Learning** — concept lessons (one per topic, multiple per day allowed)
- **🐛 Bug** — bug journal (every error encountered + how it was solved)
- **📋 Task** — feature/task documentation (every feature built)

For per-commit walkthroughs, see [`../plans/`](../plans/) — every commit ships with a beginner-friendly note.
For the V2 features playbook, see [`../FUTURE_SCOPE.md`](../FUTURE_SCOPE.md).
For the build & learning prompt for AI assistants, see [`../PROMPT.md`](../PROMPT.md).
For the commit + plan-file convention, see [`./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).

## 📊 Day 2 — Live Coverage Checklist

> Concepts covered vs pending. Updated as each commit lands. Reading this is the shortest way to know "what does my brain hold now?" without scanning git log. Each row is tagged with the commit number that covers it — `git checkout Day_NN` to revisit.

### Concepts covered ✅

- [x] **Server vs Client Components** — `"use client"` opts a file (and everything it imports) into the client bundle. Server is the default. — `Day_04`
- [x] **The boundary is the file**, not the component — `Day_04`
- [x] **What can cross the server→client boundary** — serializable props yes; functions no — `Day_04`
- [x] **Folder = URL segment**; `page.tsx` makes it real — `Day_05`
- [x] **`layout.tsx` wraps everything below it** and persists across navigation — `Day_05`
- [x] **Route groups `(name)`** organize layouts without adding a URL segment — `Day_05`
- [x] **`layout.tsx` vs `template.tsx`** — persistent vs re-mounting — `Day_05`
- [x] **`(app)` route group exists**, home page moved into it — `Day_06`
- [x] **`git mv` for atomic page rename** — preserves file history — `Day_06`
- [x] **`(auth)` route group exists** with a *different* shell — `Day_07`
- [x] **Two visibly different layouts from one URL tree** (`/` and `/sign-in`) — `Day_07`
- [x] **`<Link>` for client-side navigation** — typed routes, no full reload — `Day_08`
- [x] **Nested page has a real `<Link>` destination** (`/trips`) — `Day_08`
- [x] **`loading.tsx` as an automatic Suspense boundary** + streaming — `Day_09` (doc) + `Day_10` (code)
- [x] **`error.tsx` is a Client Component** (required by Next.js) — `Day_09` (doc) + `Day_11` (code)
- [x] **`reset()` on error boundaries** — `Day_11`
- [x] **`searchParams` as page-level input** (used for `?boom=1` trigger) — `Day_11`
- [x] **First Client Component island** inside a Server Component layout — `Day_12`
- [x] **`pnpm build` bundle inspection** — Client Components in their own chunk — `Day_12`
- [x] **Metadata API**: static `export const metadata` vs dynamic `generateMetadata` — `Day_13` (doc) + `Day_14` (code)
- [x] **`title.template`** for composed page titles like "Trips · Buddies" — `Day_14`
- [x] **OpenGraph metadata** per page — `Day_14`

### Concepts pending ⏳

_(none — all 22 Day 2 concepts covered. Close-out deferred to `Day_36` after the Auth Detour finishes.)_

### Deferred to later days

- [ ] Real header styling with design tokens — Day 3
- [ ] Localized strings — Day 5
- [ ] Real sign-in form with Better Auth — Day 7 (in progress via Auth Detour, see below)

---

## 📊 Auth Detour — Live Coverage Checklist

> Mid-Day-2 detour: building **full production auth** (Better Auth + Prisma + MongoDB Atlas + email/password + magic-link via Resend + Google OAuth) before closing Day 2. Pulls forward parts of Day 6 (Prisma), all of Day 7 (Better Auth), and a slice of Day 11 (Resend, just the magic-link wrapper). Runs `Day_15` → `Day_36`. Each row tagged with the commit number that covers it.

### Concepts covered ✅

- [x] **`PrismaClient` global-singleton pattern** — Fast Refresh leaks connections without it; one instance per process — `Day_15`
- [x] **MongoDB-with-Prisma quirks** — `ObjectId`, `@map("_id")`, no migrations — `Day_16`
- [x] **MongoDB Atlas provisioning** — manual cluster setup + `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` — `Day_17`
- [x] **`lib/prisma.ts` singleton file** ships + `"db:push"` script — `Day_18`

### Concepts pending ⏳

- [ ] **Better Auth overview** — what it is, why over Clerk/NextAuth — `Day_19`
- [ ] **Better Auth install + adapter** — Prisma adapter, schema-generation flow — `Day_20`
- [ ] **`better-auth` package installed**, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` generated, OAuth env vars scaffolded — `Day_21`
- [ ] **`lib/auth.ts` Better Auth server config** + User/Session/Account/Verification models in schema — `Day_22`
- [ ] **`app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`** catch-all route handler — `Day_23`
- [ ] **Email/password Server Action flow** — form data → Better Auth → cookie → redirect — `Day_24` (doc) + `Day_26` (code)
- [ ] **Sign-up page + Server Action** — `app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` — `Day_25`
- [ ] **Real sign-in form** — replaces the Day_07 stub — `Day_26`
- [ ] **Session reads in Server Actions / Server Components** — how `auth.api.getSession(...)` works — `Day_27`
- [ ] **Sign-out action** + header shows session state — `Day_28`
- [ ] **Protected pages: middleware vs layout guard** — trade-offs — `Day_29` (doc) + `Day_30` (code)
- [ ] **`(app)` layout reads session, redirects if absent** — `Day_30`
- [ ] **Magic-link via Resend** — `lib/email.ts` wrapper, Better Auth magic-link plugin — `Day_31` (doc) + `Day_32` (code)
- [ ] **OAuth callback URLs** — why `BETTER_AUTH_URL` must match Google Console — `Day_33`
- [ ] **Google Cloud Console OAuth app registered** + env vars set — `Day_34`
- [ ] **Google provider enabled + "Sign in with Google" button** — three auth methods coexist — `Day_35`
- [ ] **Auth Detour close-out** — Day 2 → ✅, Day 6 → partial, Day 7 → ✅; checklist frozen — `Day_36`

### Deferred to later days

- [ ] Full Trip CRUD with user-scoping — Day 6 proper / Day 7's `13_trips_crud_user_scoped.md`
- [ ] Broader Resend usage (trip invitations, reminders) — Day 11
- [ ] GitHub OAuth + other providers — future extension
- [ ] Edge-runtime `middleware.ts` for route protection — future revisit (we use layout-guard for now)
